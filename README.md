## Hi there, I'm Mayank ðŸ‘‹

I am a self-motivated and progress-driven **Software Engineer** with an extensive background in this industry. With a long-standing record of initiative and innovation, I have developed and executed strategies that I believe will bring value to the organization sharing the same motivation.

In my current position at Microsoft, I am working with the Azure Backup R&D team.

Azure Backup, is a critical part of the Azure Core team and also a critical Tier-0 (Ring 0) platform service for Azure. Azure Backup protects millions of data sources in the cloud with well over an Exabyte of data. We are on a mission to protect all workloads running in Azure and Managed Edge.
 
To know me better:
 - I worked on building and growing hyper-scale distributed cloud services with enterprise-grade reliability and scale. Also authored reusable, modular, scalable, performant, secure code, and delivered success and making significant customer impact across thousands of global enterprises with my deliverables.

 - I worked across  running a world-class cloud service with various technology stacks spanning system fundamentals, high scale data movers, distributed computing, highly performant cross-platform codebases, REST-based management, control plane interfaces, and UX layers.  Worked on brainstorming, design/code reviews, and cross-component integration.

 - I have taken full stack ownership and possess strong Live Site, Customer Obsessed, Quality focused work where I put forward my perspectives to the team and leverage their inputs to get the best results/decisions. I worked on designing, coding, testing, and delivery of product/features and enhancements by collaborating with multiple partner teams. I have created tools and infra to automate regular tasks.
 
 - I have the ability to learn quickly and hit the ground running, a can-do attitude, and a never-say-die spirit. I am a good team player, someone who helps others succeed. I enjoy taking risks, learning from mistakes, contributing to the success of others, and tackling hard engineering challenges. Last but not least, I am one of those who is not afraid to ask for help from others when in need.

 - I believe in empowering and enriching humanity. I connect people and new perspectives to promote inclusion, diversity, and accessibility.

"Every once in a while, a new technology, an old problem, and a big idea turn into an innovation."
